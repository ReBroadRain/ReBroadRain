# __Hi there__ ðŸ‘‹
My name is Yaroslav. I graduated from the Russian University of Transport with a degree in Organization of Transportation and Management on Railway Transport. I have been working for over 7 years, but recently I have started thinking more and more about the IT industry and neural networks. I find this field very fascinating. It's really cool to create or modernize a neural network and write code that a lot of people will use. It's very inspiring, so I decided to start training as a neural network developer

I'm still a beginner, so my profile will be empty for now, but I'm looking forward to contributing more in the future...
